# Learning Markdown was great
Doing *italics* was as simple and as quick with just a click
Creating more emphasies **boldening** 
key words made it easier for me and the team to focus and move quicker
Moving forward, 
* Allan
* Joyce
* Jb
* Ruth, 
provided their names for ease of identification into the team\.

The motto of the team was
<learn to grow\

throught the program\.

For the second bit of the training and mentorship, 
random ![Bingo](https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/card-template-with-fireworks-party-horns_1308-3021.jpg?size=626&ext=jpg&ga=GA1.2.1849806295.1628726400) 

were very essential in motivating the team\.

At the end, 
the following was the order of the names based on the first to finish
1. Allan
2. Collins
3. Joyce
4. JB

The end was a short code that I managed to develop
```
# this is the code block 
so that,
if Jb finished first,
then
he was asked to work with Joyce
